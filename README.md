Background

I'm a newbie to the artworld. However, when gaining exposure to new pieces and different techniques, I found it difficult locating a source, especially one that could deliver a steady dose of digestible information. art.Smart was conceived, with inspiration from Momentum and microlesson providers like goHighBrow. 

Solution

My concept is to provide new images every day for the user, based on images they previously saw and liked on art.Smart. If a user fancies, they can click on the painter's name or the artwork to learn more about the piece. This way, the user, in between clicks, can take 10 seconds or 10 minutes to learn more about art. 

Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: http://rakeshrpatel.com/artSmart/index.html

Technical

I used a MEAN stack for this one. So I've got AngularJS, HTML, CSS on the front-end and Express, MongoDB, and Node on the back-end.

Development Roadmap

This is v1.0 of the app, validating that there is some interest in this product (otherwise, I'll just build for myself). Future upgrades will include:
	-Create an algorithm that allows for easy, successive querying of Artsy.net's API.
	-Ability to thumbs up and down with data recorded for future API fetches.
	-Locate API with great artist and artwork bios so that users can click within browser for more information.


Art work for all.

Helping folks discover their tastes by curating paintings for them. 

Users will be able to thumbs up or down a painting. Friends at Artsy.net will receive the beckon, firing up their Art Genome Project - a huge project of cataloging the world's art.

Artwork is still a work in progress, but you can see the first installment of this vision.

And sorry in advance for mangling some great works by applying imperfect image specifications.
